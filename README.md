# Ai-course_with_Techcrush
I am now a tech4africa scholarship recipient, studying AI with Techcrush, This is my first repo.


using Logistic regression, i was able to train an ai model to predict classes in the raisin variety classification datasets.



And also while using the 5-fold- cross validation on the sample test, 74-86 accuracy was achieved.

This is my second repo on my ai bootcamp with techcrush.
